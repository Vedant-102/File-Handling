# File-Handling

In this program, we will be operating on a text file using C language. The electricity bill will be calculated & instead of directly displaying the receipt, we will first store the given data in a text file & fetch the data from the file & print it when the user asks to print the receipt. We will be using functions to handle our file:
fopen(): Opens the file in a given mode.
fclose(): Closes the file after all changes are made.
fprintf(): Writes data to the file.
fgetc(): Gets a character from the file.
